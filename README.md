# RaspCT basic interaction scripts
This repository includes necessary files for creation and processing of projections, aquiered by the RaspCT scanner. 
This project is based on a student project of mine for medical systems engineering. 
The goal is to create a low cost, portable prototype CT imaging system for student experiments.

## BOM
* 1x Raspberry Pi min. 3B
* 1x Raspberry Pi camera V1
* 1x  10 by 10 cm scintillation screen (from used X-ray casettes, Gd2O2S:Tb recommended)
* 1x Xray source (e.g. Moxtek® MAGPRO 60kV 12W commercial benchtop source)
* 1x Stepper Motor, 4 wire
* 1x low Voltage Stepper Motor Driver (e.g. ST Micro STSPIN220)
* some 3d printed tables, enclosures and mounts
* aluminium profiles for rigid, portable mounting

The cost of all parts was 200 €, excluding the X-Ray source.
